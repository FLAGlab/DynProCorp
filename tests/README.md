# Tests

All implementations for the exemplars in the repository **must** comply with the following test scenarios.

## Test set-up

To compare the different implementations fairly, we use specific scenarios setting-up all program entities and their relations.

## Use Cases

All tests cases are described from use cases describing the intended interaction and result of the test. Each test case may use a defined set of data (also available in the repository)

### Case 1 - 


#### Data

The data used for this case study is
