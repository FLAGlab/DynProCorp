# Dynamic Program Adaptation Corpus

This repository contains a corpus of example programs of adaptation types using different programming language mechanisms.
The implementations are all based on the following exemplars:
1. Smart home advertising
2. Network forwarding

## Metaprogramming

### Ad hoc reflection

The current implementation of Ad hoc reflection are:
- Python
- JavaScript

### Metaobject protocol

There are two current implementations using MOP
- A SmallTalk implementation on exemplar [2]
- A CLOS implementation on exemplar [2]

## Built-in mechanisms

### Proxies

(Java)

### Mixins

The implementation of Mixins uses Ruby 

### Becomes

(SmallTalk)

## Programming paradigms

### Aspect-oriented programming

(CaesarJ)

### Context-oriented programming
The current implementations of COP to realize dynamica adaptations are:
- Context Traits (JavaScript) implementing exemplars [1,2]

### Role-oriented programming

(ObjectTeams)

## Program transformations

### Instrumentation

(Java)

### Macros

(CLOS)
